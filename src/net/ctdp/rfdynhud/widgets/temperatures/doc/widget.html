The <strong>TemperaturesWidget</strong> renders temperature informations of the engine, tires and brakes.
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>Engine</u></strong><br />
The engine's optimum temperature is denoteed in the headline and is marked with the green line in the temperature bar.
Optimum temperature in rFactor1 doesn't mean maximum horse power, but normal life time.
An higher temperature means lower lifetime and a lower temperature means a higher lifetime.
The gray line marks the temperature, that should be your peak level during a race.
The yellow line marks the temperature, where the engine really starts to overheat.
And finally the orange line marks the temperature, where the engine has half of its lifetime.
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>Tires</u></strong><br />
The headline tells you about the mounted tire compound and its optimum temperature (where it produces maximum grip).
The displayed temperatures are the average temperatures over the whole tire surface.
The value in parentheses is the deviation from the optimum temperature.
The tire graphics show optimum (hot) temperature of a tire slice (outer, middle and inner) in yellow color, cold in blue and overheating in red.
The green line just marks the vertical middle and the black graph shows deviation from optimum <u>grip</u>.
When the graph toughes the upper or lower bound of the rectangle, this tire part produces 50% of its maximum grip.
</p>

<p>
<strong><u>Brakes</u></strong><br />
The blue line marks the values, below which brakes are cold and will produce half of maximum brake torque.
The two yellow lines mark the lower and upper bounds of optimum temperature range. Brakes will wear normally in this range and will produce maximum brake torque.
The red line marks the overheating temperature, above which brakes will wear much faster and will produce half of maximum brake torque.
