{"name":"rfDynHUD","tagline":"rfDynHUD means rFactor Dynamic HUD and is a feature rich, configurable and extendable dynamic HUD system for rFactor (1 and 2) and now also other sims.","body":"### Welcome to the rfDynHUD page\r\nrfDynHUD is configured through ini files, which are created and modified using the provided editor, which is kinda self-documentary. Please [read the readme](http://readme.ctdp.net/rfdynhud/readme.html) with care to learn how to use this plugin.\r\n\r\n###### The internal code structure has been tweaked to allow for better binding capabilities to other sims.\r\n\r\n### [Download 1.4.0 release](https://github.com/CTDP/rfDynHUD/releases/download/1.4.0/rfdynhud-2014-07-26.zip)\r\n\r\n![Ecclestone TV](http://www.ctdp.net/tl_files/ctdp/rfdynhud/rfDynHUD - 1.2.0 - Ecclestone TV.jpg)\r\n![Editor](http://www.ctdp.net/tl_files/ctdp/rfdynhud/rfDynHUD - 1.2.0 - editor.jpg)\r\n![Garage](http://www.ctdp.net/tl_files/ctdp/rfdynhud/rfDynHUD - 1.2.0 - garage.jpg)\r\n![Many Widgets](http://www.ctdp.net/tl_files/ctdp/rfdynhud/rfDynHUD - 1.2.0 - many Widgets.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Your personal live overlays\r\nCreate your own custom overlays of live data for rFactor with as much or as little information as you want. rfDynHUD comes with its own intuitive editor which allows you to define when and which overlays are shown to you. These overlays can be heavily customized to suit your needs. You can create different overlays for each session, car and mod.\r\n\r\n### Many widgets, not just for drivers\r\nSeveral overlays sets and dozents of single widgets are included with rfDynHUD. Ecclestone TV simulates TV-coverage overlays, while other sets are better for drivers or for race directors.\r\n\r\n### Build your own HUD\r\nrfDynHUD is Open Source and licensed under [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).
