<p>
The <strong>screenshotSet</strong> property displays the currently used Screenshot-Set for editor backgrounds.
</p>

<p>
Switch to another set by using the &quot;Screenshot Set&quot; sub menu under the &quot;Resolutions&quot; menu
from the menu bar.
</p>

You can change the editor background images, so that they look like you use to see your rFactor.
Do this by creating one screenshot for each of the resolutions, that you see under the "Resolutions" menu (menu bar).
If you're lazy, just create a screenshot for the resultion, that you want to use in the editor.
But we encourage you to create a complete set of screenshots and send them to us, so that we can provide them as
additional downloads.
</p>

<p>
After you created those screenshots copy them to a new folder under the editor\backgrounds folder in the plugin folder.
There you'll find a folder called &quot;default&quot;, which contains the default screenshot-set.
Restart the editor and drop down the Resolutions menu from the menu bar. The first entry &quot;Screenshot Set&quot;
opens a sub menu, where you can select your newly created custom screenshot set.
