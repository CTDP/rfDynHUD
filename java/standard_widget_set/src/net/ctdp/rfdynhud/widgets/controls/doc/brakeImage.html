<p>
The <strong>brakeImage</strong> property defines the image file name to use for the brake bar.

If this is NOT set to no-image, it will override the color property.

The image must contain both the background and the dynamic bar image.<br />
If the bar is drawn vertically (default), the background is taken from the left half of the image
and the dynamic bar from the right half.<br />
If the bar is drawn horizontally, the background is taken from the right half of the image
and the dynamic bar from the left half.<br />
